###################### DONE###############################

Kasper:
- Find 1 or 2 different algorithms to implement (Tjek)
- Implement counter function of frames survived(Tjek)
- Implement function that saves the model after x number of epochs, so we can make smaller runs (Tjek)

Sasha:
- Find 1 or 2 different algorithms to implement (Tjek)
- Implement a function that can specify the scenarios to test in (needs to adapt to number of keys allowed) (Tjek)

Hans:
- Find 1 or 2 different algorithms to implement (Tjek)
- Figure out a optimal reward function (it should work for different scenarios) (Tjek)
- Write about the process so far (introduction to project framework and scope of project) (Tjek)



############################### To do list ######################

Kasper:
- Read about A2C and start doom implementation
- Get TensorBoard working
- Read through the A2C links on implementation provided by Kasper
- Run gdoom on Kaspers computer and get result into a tabel. Kills/Frames survived.

Sasha:
- Read about A2C and start doom implementation
- Get TensorBoard working
- Action Matrix should be define in a way that action should be able to customised for each scenario ( Policy gradient)
- Read through the A2C links on implementation provided by Kasper

Hans:
- Write sort teori on the Policy gradient
- Read about A2C and start doom implementation
- Get TensorBoard working
- Read through the A2C links on implementation provided by Kasper
- Look into getting the groom environment to work on 3 scenarios.
