Kasper:
- Find 1 or 2 different algorithms to implement
- Implement counter function of frames survived
- Implement function that saves the model after x number of epochs, so we can make smaller runs

Sasha:
- Find 1 or 2 different algorithms to implement
- Implement a function that can specify the scenarios to test in (needs to adapt to number of keys allowed)

Hans:
- Find 1 or 2 different algorithms to implement
- Figure out a optimal reward function (it should work for different scenarios)
- Write about the process so far (introduction to project framework and scope of project)
